
BUILD - Study of time efficiency of four construction methods of an 
electronic component.

Four technicians (TECH) were selected for the study.  The experimenter
used a Latin square design with columns as `technician' and rows as
`time period' (PERIOD).  The construction methods (METHOD) were
randomized to the technicians and time periods according to the Latin
square arrangement.  The response (MINUTES) is the construction time
for the component.
