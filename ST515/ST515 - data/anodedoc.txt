
ANODE - a two-factor factorial experiment on the effects of TEMPERATURE
and POSITION in a furnace on carbon anode DENSITY.

There were three furnaces, each kept at a particular temperature (the
fixed effect of interest).  In each furnace, there were two positions
(consider this to be a random effect, crossed with temperature).
Eighteen anodes (the experimental units) were randomly assigned to
the six temperature-position combinations, three anodes (replicates) 
per combination.

The response of interest is the density of an anode after a period
of incubation in the furnace.
