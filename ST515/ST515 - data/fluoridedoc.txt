
FLUORIDE - results of an experiment by dentists at the Mayo Clinic studying
the effect of different orthodontic cements on fluoride loss.  Ten human
teeth were assigned to each of six cement types in a completely randomized
design, i.e., each tooth received a single cement type.  The protocol was:
fluoride measured in small biopsy --> band cemented to tooth --> tooth
bathed in synthetic saliva for three weeks --> band removed and fluoride
measured in another biopsy.
