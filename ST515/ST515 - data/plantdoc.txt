PLANT - from a study of the effects of CO2 and temperature on plant
growth.  Twelve environmental chambers were used, with each chamber
receiving a particular combination of CO2 concentration and temperature.
In each chamber, twelve plants of each of three species were grown over
a 127-day period.  The data from the twelve plants of a particular 
species in a particular environmental chamber were averaged to obtain a 
single summary of the growth of that species in that environmental 
chamber.  The variables are:

chamber 	1-12

co2		CO2 treatment: 0 = ambient (380 ppm)
	                       1 = high (580 ppm), 

temp		root temperature: 0 = 13 deg C, 1 = 18 deg C

species 	0 = Squirreltail, C3 grass
    	  	1 = Wyoming big sagebrush, C3 shrub
		2 = Thurber's needlegrass, C3 grass

plant.wt 	total plant weight

shoot.wt 	shoot weight (leaves + stems)

root.wt 	root weight

lf.area 	leaf area

rs.ratio	root:shoot ratio (root weight / shoot weight)
