
ALLOY - Three formulations of an ALLOY were prepared with four separate
CASTINGs for each formulation (i.e., there were 12 distinct castings, so
that CASTING is nested within ALLOY).  Two bars from each casting were 
tested for tensile STRENGTH.  Assume that ALLOY and CASTING are both 
random effects.
