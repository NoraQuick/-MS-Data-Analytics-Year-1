
ORANGE - Data from an irrigation experiment conducted in a Valencia orange
grove.  Six irrigation treatments were used in eight blocks of trees.
The treatments were randomly assigned to six plots within each block of
trees.  The response is the weight in pounds of harvested fruit from each
plot.

   METHOD:  1 = trickle           4 = sprinkler
            2 = basin             5 = sprinkler + spray
            3 = spray             6 = flood
