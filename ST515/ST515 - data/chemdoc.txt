CHEM - A chemical production process consists of a first reaction with
an ALCOHOL and a second reaction with a BASE.  A 3x2 factorial experiment
was conducted with four replicate reactions for each of the six treatment
combinations.  The response is percent yield.

Note that ALCOHOL and BASE are both categorical variables, i.e., they 
are not ordered in any way.
