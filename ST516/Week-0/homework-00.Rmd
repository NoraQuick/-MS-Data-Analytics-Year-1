## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## A sample question

Fill in your name between the quotes `"`:
```{r}
name <- "Nora"
name
```

Here's another code chunk, you don't need to edit it, just run it:
```{r}
chars <- strsplit(name, split = "")[[1]]
chars <- chars[chars != " "]
prop_vowels <- mean(grepl("[aeiouAEIOU]", chars))
prop_vowels
```

The name, `r name`, is `r round(prop_vowels, 2) * 100`% vowels.

## Some details on your R install

```{r}
# sessionInfo() gives information about your R version,
# so I can check you have everything you need
sessionInfo()
```
