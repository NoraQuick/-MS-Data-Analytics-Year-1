```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

**Consider the following vector:**

```{r}
set.seed(12345)
y <- sample(1:100, 20, replace = TRUE)
y
```

Write code in the chunks below to answer these questions:

* **Are the values in `y` less than or equal to 50?**

    ```{r}
   y <= 50
    ```

* **How many values in `y` are less than or equal to 50?**
    
    ```{r}
   sum(y <= 50)
    ```

* **What proportion of values in `y` are less than or equal to 50?**

    ```{r}
   mean(y <= 50)
    ```

* **Which values in `y` are less than or equal to 50?**

    ```{r}
   y[y <= 50]
    ```
    
* **Which values in `y` are greater than 25 *and* less than 75?**

    ```{r}
   y[y > 25 & y < 75]
    ```

* **Which values in `y` are less than 25 *or* greater than 75?**

    ```{r}
   y[y < 25 | y > 75]
    ```
